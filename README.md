XBMCLauncher (Kodi Launcher)
============================

This is a fork of the original app from https://github.com/blunden/XBMCLauncher

A helper app to allow setting Kodi (or one of its forks) as your Launcher 
in Android without modifying the XBMC app.

Additionally it has an option to fix permissions on /sys/class/display/mode
on some broken (but rooted!) Amlogic ROMs (for example MXQ Pro 4k) to allow 
dynamic refresh rate switching by Kodi.
